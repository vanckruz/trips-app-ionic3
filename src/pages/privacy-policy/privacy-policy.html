            Information collected by Cookies. Ridj-it uses cookies on the Website to improve the quality of the Website and Services to you. A cookie is a small text file on your computer which a website sends to your computer to allow the website to store information which uniquely identifies Ridj-it’s users. Ridj-it's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in Ridj-it’s secured databases. You can always delete the cookies and reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent. If you reset your browser, some of the Site features and functionality may not be available to you and you may not be able to take advantage of all the features on the Site.                            
        </p>
        <p>
            Do Not Track. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Ridj-it is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Ridj-it Site for third party purposes, and that is why Ridj-it provides the opt-out links below. However, Ridj-it does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
